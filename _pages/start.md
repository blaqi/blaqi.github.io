## So what is mascot, exactly?

Mascot brings life to a brand, business  or an event. No one can resist a funny character. It is a non-intrusive way of marketing or promoting your brand. It also costs less than mainstream media. Did you know that a mascot could be used as a sales tool at a conference or trade event, to help promote and sell products or services, or, as an entertainment tool for a live performance?

Mascots bring visual, verbal and auditory elements together to develop lasting brand experiences, brand awareness and recall.
